# Graphics Simulation of Solar System


A simulation of the Solar System has been created, incorporating the actual model and relative metrics. The orbits of the planets were modeled according to Keplerâ€™s third law, and the diameters were measured in relation to each other. Texture mapping was applied to the planets and the sun, with an object file used for the satellite. Views, including one from the satellite and an overhead perspective of the entire solar system, can be toggled. Collision detection between the sun and another celestial body has been simulated, as seen in the accompanying snapshot.
